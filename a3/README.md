TAKE NOTE: Make sure to link the reset css style sheet before applying your style.css file in the head section of your index.html file. Keep in mind that when you apply the reset.css, you will lose all default browser styling and will need to manually add styling to ensure that it translates across all devices. One example can be seen with the bullets on your list tags disappearing after applying reset css. To get the bullets to show again you could style as follows: 
ul{
  list-style-type: disc; 
   list-style-position: inside; 
}
